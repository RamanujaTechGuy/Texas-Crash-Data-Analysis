# Texas Crash-Data-Analysis ‚Äì Interactive Power BI Report

This project explores **1.15 M+** crash records from Texas (2015 - 2025) to uncover temporal, spatial, demographic and behavioural patterns behind road-traffic accidents.  
The analysis is delivered as an interactive Power BI report with two pages:

1. **State-wide Overview** ‚Äì macro trends, injury severity and a crash-location map.  
2. **Demographic & Contributing-Factor Deep-Dive** ‚Äì who, when and why accidents happen most.

| Visual | Insight | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| üìä **Top 15 Ages by Crash Count** | 18-25 year-olds dominate; Age 21 is highest (~2.5 k crashes) | Dynamic ‚Äì respects City/County slicers |
| üìà **Hour-of-Day bar chart** | Evening rush (18:00-21:59) is risk-iest; early afternoon lull (13:00-15:59) | Ordered descending for quick scanning |
| üè∑ **Horizontal bar ‚Äì Top 5 Contributing Factors** | ‚ÄúWrong Way ‚Äì One Way Road‚Äù is 10√ó more common than #2 cause | Shows counts; hover for % of total |

## 5. Key Findings  

1. **Temporal spikes** ‚Äì Weekday evenings (18-22h) and January months record the highest crash volumes.  
2. **Young drivers** ‚Äì 18-25 age bracket contributes >20 % of all incidents, mirroring national statistics.  
3. **Fatality share** ‚Äì Although fatal injuries make up just **7 %** of crashes, they cluster heavily around inter-city highways.  
4. **Driver behaviour** ‚Äì Wrong-way driving on one-way roads is the single most cited contributing factor, signalling signage or enforcement gaps.
